# Supervised-Learning
Two different datasets are used in this project -

Regression of Hotel Price Booking Prediction

Classification of Vehicle loan approval prediction

The main goal of the project is to understand the applications of different machine learning algorithms - Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Ensembles (Bagging, Boosting, Random Forest) and analyse the best model performance. The analysis on these datasets is done using Python and the code can be run sequentially in Jupyter Notebook.
